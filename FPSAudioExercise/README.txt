FPSAudioExercise
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Project done during my formation at 3W Academy in 01/22. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What I learned :
- FPS controller (using the Unity Character Controller component + custom script)
- Interface implementation (for interaction with interactable objects such as doors or NPCs)
- Unity audio tools : spatial audio and other AudioSource parameters, AudioMixer effects (lowpass, duck, reverb), audio reverb zone component.
- Use AudioSource data in code (example: activate/deactivate a light depending on the music bass).

Highlights :
- Interact with the nightclub's door to activate / deactivate the low-pass effect on the music. 
- Walk in the nigthclub to experiment the spatial sound
- Watch the lights pulsing in rythm with the bass !
- Walk and run in the cave to hear the reverb effect on your footsteps.
