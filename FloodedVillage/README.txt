Flooded Village
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Project done during my formation at 3W Academy in 02/22. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What I learned :
- Interacting with Unity tilemap in code
- UI animations
- Tutorials

Highlights :
- My first kind-of-polished mini game !
- Interactive tutorial 
- Some basic level design research
- A quick way to see my programming skills +1 year ago and how I kept on improving them after school (my scenes were a complete mess, I had no idea about game architecture nor refactorizing my code - but still, it worked perfectly !)

Material : art was given by the school ; music, sound and cursors were from free online libraries.
